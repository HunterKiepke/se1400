        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>

        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>GridIron Central will feature comprehensive football coverage including live scores, game recaps, player
            statistics, team rankings, breaking news, expert analysis, fantasy football insights, and historical data
            for both NFL and college football. The site will include multimedia content such as highlight videos, player
            interviews, and interactive features like live game tracking and prediction tools.</p>

        <h4>Where will you get all the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
        <p>Content will be sourced from official NFL and NCAA partnerships, licensed sports photography services,
            freelance sports writers and analysts, user-generated content, and original reporting. Images will come from
            Getty Images, AP Photos, and team media departments. Text content will be created by in-house writers and
            guest contributors with expertise in football analysis.</p>

        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>Football fans deserve a dedicated platform that provides deeper, more focused coverage than general sports
            sites. GridIron Central will offer specialized insights, advanced analytics, and a community-driven
            experience that caters specifically to football enthusiasts who want more than just basic scores and
            headlines.</p>

        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>While ESPN and other major sports networks cover multiple sports, there's a gap in the market for a
            football-first platform that provides comprehensive coverage without the distraction of other sports.
            Football is America's most popular sport, and fans deserve a specialized platform that understands their
            specific needs and interests.</p>

        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>Users should engage with live game content, participate in community discussions, access detailed statistics
            and analysis, use fantasy football tools, read expert opinions, watch highlights and interviews, and return
            regularly for the latest football news and insights. The goal is to become their primary destination for all
            things football.</p>

        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>The primary goal is to become the leading digital destination for football fans, providing comprehensive
            coverage that combines the immediacy of social media with the depth of traditional sports journalism. We aim
            to build a passionate community of football enthusiasts while establishing ourselves as the go-to source for
            football content, analysis, and engagement.</p>
